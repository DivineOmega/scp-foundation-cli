# SCP Foundation CLI

**Disclaimer: This is currently just a code dump of an old project. Although it should be usable in its current form, it is not documented, or in a very good state at all. I'd love to revist this at some point in the near future.**

The aim of his project is to create a text-based command line server that emulates a server that may exist in the fiction world of [SCP Foundation](http://www.scp-wiki.net/).
